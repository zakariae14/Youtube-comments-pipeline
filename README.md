# Youtube-comments-pipeline
build a pipeline to extract youtube comments and load them to mysql database




An ETL pipeline was constructed for the purpose of gathering and processing YouTube video comments. This project harnessed Python, the YouTube Data API, Pandas, and MySQL to automate the collection, transformation, and storage of comment data, including associated like counts. The data extraction process was optimized to manage paginated results efficiently. Once collected, the data was structured into a Pandas DataFrame, making it suitable for subsequent analysis. The pipeline also established a connection to a MySQL database, ensuring the systematic storage of this valuable user-generated content. The automated process, managed by Apache Airflow, allows for scheduled updates, thereby keeping the data relevant and consistent for ongoing insights. This versatile project is capable of scaling to handle multiple videos and can be adapted for broader data analysis initiatives.
